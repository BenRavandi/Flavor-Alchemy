## Description

Developers are often tasked with retrieving data from another application's API and using it in the context of their own. Third-party APIs allow developers to access their data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL. The purpose of this application is to build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.

## User Story
AS a new  USER, I can create a profile where I can specify my dietary preferences (e.g., vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free), allergies, and flavor preferences.
Returning users should be able to update their profile settings at any time

## Acceptance Criteria
- The application should provide a search functionality for pasta recipes.

- Users should be able to search recipes based on dietary preferences, such as vegetarian or gluten-free.

- Each recipe should include a list of ingredients and clear step-by-step instructions.

- The recipe information should be easy to read and accessible on desktop.

- The application could offer video tutorials for certain recipes to assist users in the cooking process.
